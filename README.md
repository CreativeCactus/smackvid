# SmackVid

A precursor to the SmackTutorial concept, this script is used to pull two or more videos from youtube and apply the audio of one or more to another, hopefully resulting in an interesting contrast.

This can be extended to work with spectographs of audio or video to correlate events, and with offset flags or even snippets to create better content.
